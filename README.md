# my-portfolio
A portfolio site of my personal and professional projects related to web development and product management
This portfolio site was built from scratch using HTML and CSS.
I used agile process planning to come up with features for first MVP- https://moms-can-co.github.io/blog/doshi_cohort5_agile_product_planning_blog.html
I started the process with creating a html site map

My lessons during the creation of the portfolio website-
1) Having a handy steps for github repo helps
2) How having naming conventions of the file matters and it should be consistent.
3) Troubleshooting  and validating using W3Cschools validator
4) Importance of nesting during writing of code and the sufficient commenting
5) How to search, save edit and use images to get the right image size on the website
6) I learnt using the float prorperty to arrange the page for easier viewing
7) This being the first time using CSS, I have used it minimally and hopefully future braches I can make changes that are more in line with my vision for the portfolio
8) using google for searching color palettes is very helpful instead of coming up with my own set of colors
9) My eventual goal for it is to make it responsive and concise for best user experience.
10) i have a very shallow understanding of figma but quickly gave up and used paper and pen instead for wireframing
